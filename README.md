# LinkSurfer

Just a fun project.

Give it a URL, and it finds any URL's in the page given. Any found URL's are added to a queue database, then continues with the next one in queue. This continues until all URL's in the queue have been scanned. It ignores certain files like Javascript, CSS, ASP, and XML Files.

Bonus: As it scans images, it will provide a preview. For fun.
