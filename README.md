# LinkSurfer

Just a fun project.

Give it a URL, and it finds any URL's in the page given. It adds it to a queue in DB, then continues with the next one in queue. This continues until all URL's in the queue have been scanned. It ignores certain files like Javascript, CSS, ASP, and XML Files.

As it scans images, it will provide a preview. For fun.
